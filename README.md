## Usage
Download and install Miniconda from the <a href=https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/></a>
We use PyTorch 2.0.1, and mmcv 2.0.0 for the experiments.
```bash
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv=2.0.0"
```

After install the two repos, install timm and einops, i.e.,
```bash
pip install timm==0.4.9 einops
```

After downloading the pretrained models, please conduct the experiments by running

```bash
